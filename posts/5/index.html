  <div class="entry-content"><p>When you have a large environment that can and does have a number of fingers into things, there is always the possibility that something could go awry on bootup such that you cannot boot fully into the OS.  When you do this, it&rsquo;s common practice to use Grub options or a CD to boot into single-user mode and then do whatever it is you need to do.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, you get booted into single and go to edit a file, say&hellip; /etc/fstab for example, and when you open it shows as &ldquo;readonly&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple trick to do once you&rsquo;re logged in as root at a single-user prompt to do the work you need to do.  run:</p>

<p><strong>mount / -o remount,rw</strong></p>

<p>This will remount the root filesystem as read-wwrite during maintenance so you can edit whatever you like in the /etc directory (or anything else residing on the root filesystem.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had to use this a number of times for varying reasons, and thought it might help you a bit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s not terribly often I have a &ldquo;get real&rdquo; moment with Linux in general and the community in particular (the latter more often than the former to be sure), but I am at that point again.</p>

<p>My thought exercise deals primarily with desktop computing, not the server-space.  Why, you may ask?</p>

<p>In the server space, you rarely have the OS wars, zealotry, flame-fests, and all-out fanboy-ism.  Server admins do their jobs, install, deploy, commission, decommission, and serve the user space quite happily from their distro of choice, oftentimes with the users blissfully unaware of the underlying technology.  All they know is that their application is up, available, and it just works.</p>

<p>No, my thoughts are on the user space&hellip;the desktop.  The wild west.</p>

<p>If you look around, there is a large base of desktop Linux and UNIX users out there.  From RedHat to Ubuntu or straight Debian, to Slack, SuSE, or Gentoo (to name but a few) there is every shape and color of environment to choose from sporting an innumerable selection of implementations of X, Windowing environments, and associated &ldquo;enabling&rdquo; technologies.</p>

<p>It often seems that here is where the largest OS wars are waged.  The Desktop Space.  It even appears that more and more the server side is firmly entrenched in business at all levels, yet the advance and hold of the desktop space is tenuous as ever.  Why?</p>

<p><strong>The Apps</strong></p>

<p>There was a time that it was believed it was all about the apps and the platform didn&rsquo;t really matter.  As long as the user could get their email and browse YouTube, it didn&rsquo;t really matter <em>how</em> they got there, as long as they did and piano-playing cats satiated their need for video novelty.</p>

<p>Problem is, that turned out to be far from the case.</p>

<p>No one can deny that with the appropriate gyrations, anyone can use an installation of Linux.  There&rsquo;s apps there, web browsers with all the lovely plugins we&rsquo;re used to and with analogues to just about everything we could need in a 21st century computing world.</p>

<p>Still, Linux makes no advance.</p>

<p><strong>The Community</strong></p>

<p>The Linux community is somewhat of a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, you have the largest user community (and by implication, support community) ever to come together for any technology.  It is lauded as the best operating system because of this community in particular.  All this is true.  You can find as many people as you can computers in this world, all with their own take on Linux and it&rsquo;s place in the world.  From the anti-&ldquo;other guy&rdquo; fanatics to the &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just the best&rdquo; aficionados, there is more than you could ever want in the way of free (not $1.00/minute) support you could ever want.</p>

<p>Still, Linux makes no advance.</p>

<p><strong>The Administrators</strong></p>

<p>In the admin&rsquo;s world, everything is very easy.  You use kickstart to clone machines to a similar (or identical) base installation upon which to work your techno-sorcery for your employer.  You may use puppet, opsware, or other tools to unify configuration management across the enterprise.  You manage your ticket tracking on open-source products running on Linux systems providing sometimes millions of pageviews to the public.  But sitting on your desk, usually mandated by the selfsame company, is a Windows laptop or desktop issued to you by your overlords to use as your primary desktop.</p>

<p>Still Linux makes no advance.</p>

<p><strong>Jobs</strong></p>

<p>You are looking for work.  From your Linux laptop you surf the sea of recruiting sites looking for that perfect Linux gig.  Suddenly, you find it.  All the pieces are there for you to really help make a difference and make this environment just sing.  The money&rsquo;s good, and the hours and dress code are outstanding.  Best yet, they have a clue and allow you to have a Linux desktop and you even manage the mail,  and calendaring  servers that all fully support Linux!  You click the link, are redirected to the recruiting website, and are greeted with a &ldquo;Sorry, but this is an Internet Explorer Only Website.  We are sorry for any inconvenience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Internet Explorer Only.  For a Linux only job.  At a Linux shop.  Serving a Linux infrastructure.  Let&rsquo;s say you manage to wrangle an email address of a recruiter and get through&hellip; He asks for a resume.  You provide your normal PDF, TXT, or HTML resume for his convenience only to be told &ldquo;We require Word 2007 format.  It&rsquo;s all our system understands, and we cannot get you into our system without it&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Still Linux makes no advance.</p>

<p><strong>Inertia</strong></p>

<p>All these things happen in myriads of ways to different people in different enterprise situations every day.  Either one piece of the puzzle isn&rsquo;t there, or some part of the communications chain departs from Linux compatibility, or some other vital piece of the puzzle has gone missing, leaving Linux professionals adrift on a desolate, isolated (albeit huge) island that the rest of the world has no problems visiting, but they don&rsquo;t want to own land there.</p>

<p>The server space could transform into a world where Linux held 75% of the server space, and I still don&rsquo;t think you would see any more serious penetration into the end-user world than you do today.  Why?</p>

<p><strong>Integration &amp; Documentation</strong></p>

<p>One thing Microsoft has done correctly is build an end-to-end playground for it&rsquo;s users.  Sure, some of the swings are broken and if you don&rsquo;t use that merry-go-round quite right it could kill you, but it <em>is</em> a complete playground, and it <em>is</em> the prettiest one on the block.  You don&rsquo;t need to have directions, you just <em>know</em> how to use all the toys, and you can get around without any training or supervision.</p>

<p>On the other hand, out there in the Linux playground there isn&rsquo;t the same set of toys, and some of the slides don&rsquo;t go all the way down. You have to be careful on those monkey-bars since the rough edges haven&rsquo;t been sanded and painted like you&rsquo;d expect and nothing really works like anything you&rsquo;ve seen and there&rsquo;s none of those cool little signs along the playground showing you how to navigate around and get from game to game.</p>

<p>This can be frustrating enough to make you want to walk back across the street to the lesser sized, lesser featured, lesser capable playground where everything is neatly painted and clearly marked.  All the slidesgo all the way down, and little to no work is necessary on your part other than to just play and have fun.</p>

<p><strong>What?</strong></p>

<p>Ok, what did my putrid attempt at metaphor say?</p>

<p>Simple.  Given enough time, research, and effort, you can do ANYTHING with Linux you set your mind to do.  From browsers to flash to office suites to just about anything you can think of. (even including running many Windows games and tools through amazing products like Crossover)</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s one thing there that we forget (especially in America) regarding that whole experience&hellip;  It requires work, forethought, research, inference, a little ingenuity and a lot of  what no Windows or Mac box ever requires of you&hellip;  effort.  (stick with me for a moment)</p>

<p>The effort in Windows/Mac-land has been moved.  It&rsquo;s on the &ldquo;have problems&rdquo; end.  The second or third experience set you have with your system.  In Linux-land, it&rsquo;s all been front-loaded.  You have to climb all those hills and overcome all those obstacles <em>first</em> before you get anywhere.</p>

<p><strong>The Way Forward</strong></p>

<p>The only way that Linux will start to proceed and ultimately overcome on the desktop is when the effort bubble moves further away from the initial experience.  The user will have to be able to sit down and do absolutely everything they&rsquo;ve ever done before with a limited amount of effort just to get going, and while most anyone is willing to learn new things, it&rsquo;ll take them being mostly trivial learning events (not ever amounting to a learning curve) before users will flock en-masse to Linux desktops.</p>

<p>As much of a Linux fanboy as I am, I&rsquo;m also sort of realistic.  Until the whole experience from start to finish is at least as smooth as a Windows or Mac world (not the same, but as smooth), lazy users will still tend toward the entropy of &ldquo;easy to use&rdquo; most every time.</p>

<p><strong>What Can We Do</strong></p>

<p>This is rather simple, actually.</p>

<p>Get on board with a project or two.  You don&rsquo;t have to know how to code, just help write documentation.  Learn how the product you&rsquo;re supporting works <em>inside and out</em>.  Hang out on the chat rooms and support boards, and any and all questions you can answer, do so.  Help out with local Linux install-fests, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to help a local rookie personally.</p>

<p>The easier adoption becomes, the better for obtaining new &ldquo;lookers&rdquo;.  But the easier the entire process becomes, the more long-term converts you&rsquo;ll have.</p>

<p>The Linux Community can indeed grow and the products we use can, with time, become dominant.  But it starts with each of us doing everything we can to make the adoption and retention process as smooth as, or dare I say it <strong>smoother </strong>than that of the Windows and Mac world.</p>

<p>Until we reach this level of smoothness and excellence, we are destined to ride that third-place wave.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Man&hellip;  people are funny.  You tell them things many, many times and for some reason, you&rsquo;re a moron.  They come to you for help, you give them an answer and because it&rsquo;s either not convenient enough or the answer they wish to hear, you become a moron.</p>

<p>AND THEY CAME TO YOU!  Better yet, They will KEEP coming to you because deep down they know you have the right answer even though they don&rsquo;t necessarily want to hear it.</p>

<p>I learned a long time ago that System Administration is better than 70% politics.</p>

<p>That brings up a conundrum.</p>

<p>As a sysadmin, my highest priority is my machines.  If they don&rsquo;t stay up, reliable, and serving, we don&rsquo;t serve ads, and then we don&rsquo;t get paid.  As a coworker, the users are my customer.  They deserve the highest priority.  Balancing the needs of the machines (who don&rsquo;t have feelings, but have very real needs nonetheless) against the needs &amp; desires of the user community can be quite the chore sometimes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>(originally posted 1/5/2005)</em></p>

<p>So things are better…</p>

<p>I think.</p>

<p>It’s so hard to come off your favorite job ever and do something else.</p>

<p>So I continue…</p>

<p>We had a conversation on [ALE] today (<a href="http://www.ale.org">http://www.ale.org</a>) regarding sysadmins and their salaries. Some folks out there are swooning over $20/hr gigs, and I just don’t get it.</p>

<p>The professional demands of the sysadmin range from technologist to politician to therapist.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think yearly medals should be awarded.</p>

<p>Anyhow….</p>

<p>A recruiter contacted me regarding a position in Oregon @ $20/hr. I counted that an insult. I related that fact to the LUG, and found all sorts of ballyhooing about started. Now, don’t call me a prude or high-and-mighty, but I’ve been doing this stuff for 15 years as of this month. Everything from PC’s on DOS 3.3 to watching Windows come out and then NT3… you get the picture. Let’s just say I got wise and got out of the Windows market…It’s doomed anyway.</p>

<p>So, I started to get interesting comments such as:</p>

<blockquote>C’mon $20.. You could live like a king…</blockquote>




<blockquote>Hey, I phone-interviewed with a place in NC that wanted to pay $45K for a do-everything IT manager. I politely informed the gentlemen that I was making over $60K when I was already doing many of the specific things they said they needed done (and that was Government!) and that I know a Windows admin in Norcross who’s making ~48K without a degree.
They wouldn’t budge.

Get used to it.</blockquote>




<blockquote>Seems like I mentioned something along these lines last week during the H1B debate. Artificially driving salaries up based on pure unbridled greed is exactly what leads to periods of unemployment and the flood of immigrant workers. Feel free to take your shots at these companies, but understand that one day they might swing back and send you and half your peers to the unemployment line. Then that 40k will look pretty good. I’m not speculating on any one person’s worth. That obviously varies from person to person. But sometimes a position is only worth so much money to a given employer. You can either accept it, or move on to other things. Bashing the company in question and suggesting a pseudo mutiny witin the industry is not going to change things. If anything, it helps to perpetuate the growing feeling that “computer people” are over paid prima donnas. Next thing you know, you’ll be calling for a damn union.</blockquote>


<p>I think that’s enough. The last quoted suggests “psuedo-mutiny” and all that, and I think that is quite laughable. There’s piles of documentation out there regarding what a UNIX administrator is, what each level of experience is worth, and what the criteria are to measure an admin’s quality. (The Systems Administrator’s Guild maintains most of this information at <a href="http://www.sage.org">http://www.sage.org</a>) There’s even a certification track and everything. You’d think someone would use it.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the advocating of paying what someone is worth for (here’s the reference to the previous article) measurable, quantifiable work is a <em>VERY</em> old concept. I believe the original quote goes something like:</p>

<blockquote>After all, the worker deserves to have his needs met.</blockquote>


<p>Let’s look into the fact that there is a serious need for good talent. Not just book talent…not just kids with degrees, but folks with a serious dedication to their work for whatever motivation…whether just geekiness, or pride in one’s work, or a personal technical itch to be scratched. I find more people in my line of work that come from three camps:</p>

<p>I just got into this because there was money in it</p>

<p>This is pretty common right now, because we’re in the first generation of geeks that got trained right around the bust, and found themselves in a career in decline….or so they were told.</p>

<p>During the bust, I was working alongside folks that thought they could copy/paste perl scripts into a UNIX box, and voila! they were perl programmers. I also had a UNIX admin I worked with that thought he was God’s gift to systems folk when he could use that there “vi” editor. (pronounced it ‘veye’…some do, I’ve always found it quaint)</p>

<p>These will be disappointed to a degree, but will eventually get the experience and seasoning they need…in another 5 years or so. It all depends on their day of realization that this is going to be real work, and not copy/pasting other people’s work.</p>

<p>Can you believe I’m a sysadmin and I get PAID!!!</p>

<p>The perennial geek. Glad to be here, and glad to be working. Usually overworks themselves because they enjoy it. These folks progress and grow at a much faster rate than just about any other. These will be the ones taking my job considerably faster than it took me to replace the guy before me. They are in the tech for the love of it.</p>

<p>I got into this, and It’s a job
I feel sorry for these sometimes. They don’t really have any serious joy in their gig, and are waiting for retirement. I hope it was worth it.</p>

<p>I just really think it’s important you have to dig what you do. I’m not sure I’ll be able to get there with this one. I’ll try , though. In the meantime, all offers in Atlanta welcome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>(originally posted 1/1/2005)</em></p>

<p>Ever get a new gig?</p>

<p>Get a new gig when you were really in need? (i.e. laid off) Only to find out the organization was hopelessly broken in more ways than you can count?</p>

<p>Welcome to my daily life right now. I can’t guarantee I won’t be somewere else in a few months (or weeks)</p>

<p>The company I work for right now (just started on 12/27) is a huge company. (read, Fortune 20) The workflow is somewhat broken. I don’t have a permanent desk, phone, or computer. The management seems smitten with me, but I haven’t done anything yet to deserve the sentiment. In fact, I can’t see where my personal work ethic is going to fit in here at all. Lemme explain.</p>

<p>I <em>love</em> to work. Actually, I like to work <em>hard</em>. I’m not happy unless I’m busting my ass, in fact. [1]</p>

<p>Herein lies the rub.</p>

<p>Statement that needs supporting arguments #1:Corporate America doesn’t lend itself well to highly-motivated individuals in the technical field.</p>

<p>Now, find me a marketing or high-power sales guy, and they are always moving, always pushing. They’re reading all the sucess and sales tomes from the local Border’s, and doing something new nearly daily to get better and eek out one more sale or another busniess relationship. They’re usually on some commission basis, so the more they push and shove, the more money they make. It requires a continual personal reinvention.</p>

<p>Warning: Strong personal opinion aheadf this reinvention, however, is not one of substance, yet of appearance.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate.</p>

<p>It’s been said that perception is 99% of the truth. In that vein, many marketing and management types are driven to present the appropriate visage to their customer base. In fact, you’ll find “7 habits”, “Fish”, and “How to Win Friends…” on many managers desks. Alongside these perennial tomes (did I really use “tome* twice today?) of corporate enlightenment, you’ll see reports about nothing, statistics that inaccurately reference false figures deemed important, and employee records filled with inaccuracies and untruths.</p>

<p>(Wow. Is that cynical or what? The ideas are coming so terribly fast that I can’t keep up. Bear with the schizo post for a minute, will ya?)</p>

<p>For instance, In a recent contract I went to a site that did printing. Large-scale printing. The site seemed very well laid out. Apples on the desktops, big computer room. Heavy internet presence, and a freakin’ sweet Xserve implementation. (don’t kill me, John. I know it isn’t your fault, but your predecessor’s)</p>

<p>This computer room is in the most horrid shape one could imagine. The network area has been cleaned up a bit, but could still use about 192 hours of straight attention, re-racking, mapping, etc. And that’s just the physical side. One can only imagine the networking disarray. (If their admin is as good as he seems, the networking part is in much better shape, to be sure). (this doesn’t even begin to touch the computers…)</p>

<p>This machine room has a window into it, and a very nicely racked series of Dell servers and disk arrays are properly lined up right in front of the window. It really looks beautiful, but it obscures the evil disarray immediately behind it. Such is the corporate world.</p>

<p>My meaning here, to synthesze the opinion + anecdote, is not that you actually learnthe precepts presented in these books and such, but to have enough familiarity to convnce your customer that you have it all together. (or your boss, or your friends, or your parents, etc.)</p>

<p>I firmly believe that there is enough of a disconnect that the country spends all its time doing its best to try and fool their target into not hassling them instead of actually putting in the man-hours and completing the job in the first place. Similarly, the managment of this country has found a way to think damned near everything is more important than actual productivity. (weekly three-hour productivity meeting to discuss why you’re not productive, anyone?)</p>

<p>Technical folks find themselves dragged into this world of deceit in varying degrees. The disconnect between actual, technical, measurable work and having to give the semblance of actual, tecnical, measurable work is humorous at best. In fact, I’ve found in my personal experience that management has been so sold their new set of ideals that when you enumerate your workload, their incredulity is almost comical…their numbers don’t reflect that you’re busy during that time.</p>

<p>I think that the key to the futre of corporate America (and the technical world in particular) will be to eliminate the ridiculous amounts of middle management, while increasing actual technical bodies. Next, those people need to be assured 80 hours of direct classroom training yearly. (there’s more of them now, remember? they can handle one guy being out for a week at a time) Finally, machine-produced statistics and reports should be acceptable to those managers that reman and they need tohave the skill to read them, or they don’t need to be tecnical managers.</p>

<p>Statement that needs supporting arguments #2: The high number of bad techies in high-paying jobs is a crime</p>

<p>If the people I’ve come into contact with thus far are any indication, I have a bit of reason to be <em>VERY</em> upset.</p>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of years trying to learn to be better at what I do. I have spent <em>THOUSANDS</em> of my own money to have the latest books and documentation on topics that I have had to work on. I may never work on them again, but I keep the documents around just to have that resource for my company. I spend time going to Linux shows and join professional organizations just to be better. Just to be worthy of the title “Senior” in Sr. UNIX Systems Administrator.</p>

<p>Since I’ve been here, I’ve met people who couldn’t work their way out of a system down if their lives depended on it. In fact, in a company of thousands, I’ve met one guy that has demonstrated and level of qantifiable skill. He is a greatUNIX admin. Consequently, all the work in the organization gets filtered (somehow, magically) to his work queue.</p>

<p>Now, in seeming opposition to my former statement, should I work somewhere where I will get quite a bit of transferred work from people who don’t want (or are unable to)to do the work themselves?</p>

<p>I think not</p>

<p>…more to come…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;re at a new server out on the &lsquo;net. I&rsquo;ve moved all the websites I host out onto a data-center based server, and am removing all the extra hardware out of my home.</p>

<p>Why, you might ask?</p>

<p>Well, we&rsquo;re selling our home and moving into town. As such, I might be able to find the home I want. If not, I will wind up in an apartment for a time. Usually, an apartment doesn&rsquo;t have the room for the scale of server I have here at the house.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve got a few things for sale.</p>

<p>My house is a 3 Bedroom ranch home in suburban Atlanta, GA. You can see the pictures of my home from before I bought it in 4/04 here: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/questy/OurHouse">Our House</a> We&rsquo;re asking $159k. If you have any questions, contact me at <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#106;&#101;&#114;&#x61;&#108;&#x64;&#46;&#115;&#x68;&#101;&#x65;&#116;&#x73;&#64;&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#x2e;">&#106;&#101;&#x72;&#x61;&#108;&#100;&#46;&#115;&#104;&#x65;&#x65;&#116;&#115;&#64;&#x67;&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;&#x2e;</a></p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve got some servers hanging around. Since I&rsquo;ve really gotten into the whole Dave Ramsey thing, I&#8217;, selling them to apply toward my debt. My hope is to pay off nearly half of my remaining debt balance with the sale of my home and these servers.</p>

<p>I have :</p>

<p>VA Linux Full On Dual Pentium3 800MHz, 80G HDD, 1GB Ram
VA Linux Full On Dual Pentium3 500MHz, 80G HDD, 1GB Ram
VA Linux Full On Single Pentium3 500MHz, 40G HDD, 1GB Ram
VA Linux Full On Chassis to use for parts. Has extra fans, power supplies, mobo.
Linksys WAP54G Wireless Access Point
SMC 24 Port 10/100 EZ Hub 5616DS
(See pictures at end of article)</p>

<p>In addition, I have about 6 white boxes from varying generations, including P2, P3, and some earlier stuff. There&rsquo;s a few 3D Graphics cards in there, and a ton of disk space among them all. Mix &amp; Match whatever you like.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got one crappy old monitor, and a bunch of cables, computer supplies, some CAT-5 and just ods and ends I&rsquo;ve collected over a 15-year IT career.</p>

<p>I hope to sell it all together for $2000.00US. Buyer pays shipping. If I can&rsquo;t sell it all together for 2K, I&rsquo;ll have to ask more for each individual part.</p>

<p>Well, if anyone can help I&rsquo;d appreciate it. If you need a server class machine, let me know!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A good friend of mine had a statement recently in his blog&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to blog, then do it!&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>I don&rsquo;t recall in particular what he was referring to, nor can i find it on his site any more.  But ever sice reading it, I have had that phrase tickling the back of my mind.  I can&rsquo;t get it out of my head at the moment, and it has prompted me to do just that.  Here we go:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found myself in at a myriad of crossroads, resembling the spokes on a wheel&hellip;a very LARGE wheel.  There&rsquo;s dozens of directions to go, and I&rsquo;m torn between what I think I need to do, and what I <em>want</em> to do.  I&rsquo;m torn between my preference and God&rsquo;s best.  I&rsquo;m torn between churches.  I&rsquo;m torn between dwellings.  I&rsquo;m torn between  career paths. I&rsquo;m torn betwen marching and not marching.  good grief.
<strong>Today</strong>
The marching season is already underway, and I&rsquo;ve already made that commitment for the duration of the season&hellip;  At least that&rsquo;s decided.  However, I think that I must begin to seek out how to go about what is next.  Understanding that, for me at least, the marching days are going to end relatively soon.
Maybe not this season, or even the next (I&rsquo;d like to finish my 5 years), but &ldquo;soon&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Leanings</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m seeing a trend pretty much everywhere.  Among people in the ministry I have respected and loved, among friends and acquaintences&hellip;men and women of God that have my utmost respect.  They&rsquo;re leaving the traditional &ldquo;brick and mortar&rdquo; paradigm of the church and starting churches in the home.  As hard as I look, the reason God has really spoken to me regarding some of this escapes me, but I know that very soon I will be VERY involved at this level&hellip;perhaps even by creating one myself&hellip;</p>

<p>I find that every church I visit is concerned with programs and policies, methods of garnering as much financial support of the people as possible, &ldquo;cocooning into their own little world&rdquo; and doing as much as is humanly possible to segregate every part of their lives from the world.  Some of you will say, &ldquo;Well, yeah!  You should be separate from the world!&#8221;  This is different, though.  There&rsquo;s no interaction with the hurting&hellip;  There&rsquo;s no eye to the things Jesus Himself requested of us.</p>

<p>Over the next several weeks and months, I&rsquo;m going to be wondering aloud here, starting with the very basics of the faith, and working my way through just what a church is and should be.  WHat it should look like in our society, what it&rsquo;s mission is and how we are to effect the works of Christ in the Earth today.</p>

<p>I have the sneaking suspicion that it doesn&rsquo;t look a thing like what we have in front of us, and that God is calling people to bring things back to the beginning&hellip;to the place that first called us to Him.  And for those that never quite knew Him (because the church had failed them by being too full of itself to see that they were hurting and needed rescue from &ldquo;this place&rdquo; we call the world) to have an opportunity to know a God that is relevant.  One that is intimately familiar with their hurts, desires, hopes, fears, and faults but chooses to know them anyway due to the immense love He has.
Come along for this ride with me&hellip;Add your two cents.  Let&rsquo;s all work through this together, and perhaps&hellip;just perhaps we will find God at the end of the conversation, and will all be better for the journey.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, yeah&hellip; It&rsquo;s been nearly 6 months&hellip; I know.</p>

<p>Busy, busy is the best way to explain it. Heavy, full season&hellip; kids in-between, got us a dog&hellip; bought a new car.. Life in general.</p>

<p>Since I last typed, I also found that elusive new job. The job with a clue, I call it. I work for The Weather Channel now in the operations department, and love every minute of it. The staff, management, development, administrative teams&hellip; ALL of them with a clue. The hiring process had a clue. The evaluations have a clue. The company is just GREAT! Kudos to Landmark (the parent company) and TWCi for being bold enough to do things right, and not be lumped in with the seething mass of clueless employers out there.</p>

<p>Katrina hit, and I had some family down in La. that disappeared for a few days&hellip; They showed up and their home was unharmed. Another friend lost apartment and job, moved here and lives with us&hellip;just got a new job, too. Good for him.</p>

<p>Started specializing in Apache/Tomcat here at the Channel. Learned a lot of stuff about garbage collection I intend on sharing real soon as well as a comparison of the SUN &amp; BEA JVM. Interesting items there if I do say so myself.</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s still good, and watching out for us. Couldn&rsquo;t be happier.</p>

<p>More to come on the Linux &amp; Java thing real soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it&rsquo;s been quite awhile since I&rsquo;ve gotten over here to say much, but I haven&rsquo;t had much to say.</p>

<p>Things are going so well for our corps this year, there&rsquo;s no way I can express it. The staff, management, direction, focus, theme&hellip;all amazing. We got out to the Atlanta Motor Speedway this weekend to work concessions, and had a great return for our efforts. I hope we can do more of those in the future&hellip;it was great family time for the corps as well as a great money-maker.</p>

<p>Dan&rsquo;s school band went to festival, and they brought home all &ldquo;1&rsquo;s&rdquo;. Great stuff. Good reward for hard work.</p>

<p>Starting drill in two weeks. Looking forward to it.</p>

<p>more later&hellip;</p>
