Here we go.

I've been out of work since 11/30. I was happily doing some Big Brother (http://www.bb4.org) updates for my company, and I was called into a room for layoffs. In fact, nearly half the acting company was laid of the same day.

I have a tendency to worry about that kind of event, since I'm the only breadwinner in my family. However, this time I had a sense of peace throughout the whole thing. By Friday I interviewed twice, then twice again on Monday, and finally received an offer on Tuesday which I accepted on Wednesday...more on that another day.

Hopefully I can stay at this one longer. I seem to attract unstable jobs, much to my chagrin.
