We're at a new server out on the 'net. I've moved all the websites I host out onto a data-center based server, and am removing all the extra hardware out of my home.

Why, you might ask?

Well, we're selling our home and moving into town. As such, I might be able to find the home I want. If not, I will wind up in an apartment for a time. Usually, an apartment doesn't have the room for the scale of server I have here at the house.

So, I've got a few things for sale.

My house is a 3 Bedroom ranch home in suburban Atlanta, GA. You can see the pictures of my home from before I bought it in 4/04 here: [Our House](http://picasaweb.google.com/questy/OurHouse) We're asking $159k. If you have any questions, contact me at jerald.sheets@gmail.com.

Also, I've got some servers hanging around. Since I've really gotten into the whole Dave Ramsey thing, I', selling them to apply toward my debt. My hope is to pay off nearly half of my remaining debt balance with the sale of my home and these servers.

I have :

VA Linux Full On Dual Pentium3 800MHz, 80G HDD, 1GB Ram
VA Linux Full On Dual Pentium3 500MHz, 80G HDD, 1GB Ram
VA Linux Full On Single Pentium3 500MHz, 40G HDD, 1GB Ram
VA Linux Full On Chassis to use for parts. Has extra fans, power supplies, mobo.
Linksys WAP54G Wireless Access Point
SMC 24 Port 10/100 EZ Hub 5616DS
(See pictures at end of article)

In addition, I have about 6 white boxes from varying generations, including P2, P3, and some earlier stuff. There's a few 3D Graphics cards in there, and a ton of disk space among them all. Mix & Match whatever you like.

I've got one crappy old monitor, and a bunch of cables, computer supplies, some CAT-5 and just ods and ends I've collected over a 15-year IT career.

I hope to sell it all together for $2000.00US. Buyer pays shipping. If I can't sell it all together for 2K, I'll have to ask more for each individual part.

Well, if anyone can help I'd appreciate it. If you need a server class machine, let me know!
