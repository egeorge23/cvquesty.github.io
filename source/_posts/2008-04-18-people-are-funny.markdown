Man...  people are funny.  You tell them things many, many times and for some reason, you're a moron.  They come to you for help, you give them an answer and because it's either not convenient enough or the answer they wish to hear, you become a moron.

AND THEY CAME TO YOU!  Better yet, They will KEEP coming to you because deep down they know you have the right answer even though they don't necessarily want to hear it.

I learned a long time ago that System Administration is better than 70% politics.

That brings up a conundrum.

As a sysadmin, my highest priority is my machines.  If they don't stay up, reliable, and serving, we don't serve ads, and then we don't get paid.  As a coworker, the users are my customer.  They deserve the highest priority.  Balancing the needs of the machines (who don't have feelings, but have very real needs nonetheless) against the needs & desires of the user community can be quite the chore sometimes.
