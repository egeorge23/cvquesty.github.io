I read today at [Yahoo News](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nf/20080417/bs_nf/59342) that RedHat corporation will be dropping their support of consumer desktop Linux  as we've known it for all these many years.  While maintaining support for a corporate desktop, RedHat plans on keeping at what it does best, which is provide a server distribution which holds the majority in corporate implementations.
