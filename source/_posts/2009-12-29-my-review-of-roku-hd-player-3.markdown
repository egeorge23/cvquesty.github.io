We are on the verge of eliminating Cable TV, thanks to Roku. The only problem left is the dearth of programming choices. There are MANY more online video and audio networks out there all primed and ready to be carried by the likes of a Roku. Give me more programming, and I'll go with you all the way.

I *might* even pay a monthly subscription if you can get Hulu or Boxee or some other content market deal.
