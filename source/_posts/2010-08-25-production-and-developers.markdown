Somewhere in the back recesses of my mind, I was brewing a post about permissioning and the relationship between DEV and Sysadmin teams and when and how elevated access should be granted.

Well, Kyle over at [serverfault.com](http://serverfault.com) has approached this topic in a post entitled "[Should Developers Have Access to Production](http://blog.serverfault.com/post/893001713/should-developers-have-access-to-production)?".  I highly recommend this read, as it covers many of the topics I wished to cover.  I do have some additional commentary, but I'll circle back around to that and share my thoughts at a later time.
